Thought I'd add this to keep track of changes

+ Alpha 1.3
    - Added Snap. If the Windows x or y coordinates are below a certain value, the windows get snapped to
      the screen's edge. Said value can be changed in main.c by modifying the SNAP_MIN macro. Alternatively,
      users may disable Snap totally by removing/uncommenting the macro DO_SNAP

    - Added Window Scanning. Upon startup, the WM scans for windows that were there before, and manages them.
